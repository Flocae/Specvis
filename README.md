<h1>Specvis v1.1.1</h1>
<h3>Definition and usage of the application</h3>
Specvis is a desktop application designed for visual field examination in humans written in the Java programming language ensuring unrestricted portability on any personal computer or laptop. It has an intuitive and easy to use graphical user interface and does not require special computer or programming skills. We have made Specvis freely available as an open-source application based on GNU GPLv3 license. It can be downloaded and used without charge, and allows unrestricted modification. Similar to other Automated Static Perimeters, Specvis displays a single, specific, light stimulus at different locations on the computer screen, in order to assess a luminance threshold across the visual field. A comprehensive description of the application with its scientific and clinical validation can be found in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0186224">PLoS ONE article</a>. A complementary materials can be also found in its <a href="http://www.specvis.pl/documentation-for-ver-1-1-0.pdf">documentation</a>.

<h3>Source code, requirements and availability</h3>
Specvis was written in the Java programming language and requires installation of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in version 8u121 or above. You can check the JRE version by typing in the terminal or command window `java -version`. The latest version of JRE can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">here</a>.

After ensuring that the appropriate version of the JRE is installed, the current version of Specvis can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/piotrdzwiniel/Specvis/tree/master/latest_build">latest_build</a> folder. You can find there two main directories, i.e. `Specvis IntelliJ Project` and `Specvis Executable Pack`.

The first one contains complete source code of the latest Specvis release which can be imported to the IntelliJ IDEA. The second one contains Specvis application with its related files.

From the other hand, if you are interested in older versions of Specvis and their source code, you can find them in the <a href="https://github.com/piotrdzwiniel/Specvis/tree/master/old_builds">old_builds</a> folder.

Everything "around" the `latest_build` and the `old_builds` folders is a working ground for a new future realease of Specvis. So don't be surprised if content of e.g. the <a href="https://github.com/piotrdzwiniel/Specvis/tree/master/src">src</a> folder will change few times a week etc.

<h3>Running the application</h3>

After you downloaded and unpacked the `Specvis Executable Pack/Specvis.zip` file (content of the zip file in shown in the Figure 1), you can just double click on the `Specvis.jar`. You can also run Specvis from the terminal by typing `java -jar Specvis.jar`.
