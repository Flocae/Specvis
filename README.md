<h4>Under GNU GPLv3 license (or later)</h4>
Specvis is a scientifically validated free and open-source application for human visual field examination.  Website: http://neurovision.nencki.gov.pl/specvis/index.html. On the aforementioned website one can find dedicated blog, recent documentation and video tutorials.

<h1>About Specvis</h1>

Specvis is a desktop application allowing the user to test one's visual field. Specvis working principles are similar to those
of automated static perimetry. That means, it is able to estimate the minimum luminance required for the detection of a light
stimulus throughout examined visual field.

Specvis main advantages are:

<ul>
  <li>It is free and open-source;</li>
  <li>It can be run on any modern personal computer with any operation system (Win, Mac, Linux);</li>
  <li>It stores information about patients and theire results;</li>
  <li>It allows for loading custom settings templates;</li>
  <li>It presents results from the test in a readable and intuitve graphic form (eg. <b>Figure 1</b> and <b>Figure 6</b>);</li>
  <li>It enables testing of the patient's visual field for different wavelengths of the electromagnetic wave;</li>
  <li>It enables testing the whole patient's visual field due to the possibility of adjusting the fixation point location;</li>
  <li>It was validated on patients with glaucoma and compared with Medmont M700 perimeter;</li>
</ul>

<b>Figure 1.</b> The results of 27 year old healthy male who took part in the Specvis "Basic" procedure test for each eye. The graphical maps are drawn directly from the application in the form in which they are actually displayed. Marker "F" is located in the fixation point location. Marker "M" is located in the assumed blind spot location. The "dots" on x-axis and y-axis indicates the 10 degree steps counting from the fixation point.

<b>Figure 2.</b> The very first window the user will see after Specvis launch. One can here add new patient to the Specvis database, edit data of already existing patient, preview the results of the chosen patient, and load existing settings template.
