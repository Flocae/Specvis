<h1>About Specvis</h1>

Specvis is a desktop application allowing the user to test one's visual field. Specvis working principles are similar to those
of automated static perimetry. That means, it is able to estimate the minimum luminance required for the detection of a ligth
stimulus throughout examined visual field.

Specvis main advantages are:

<ul>
  <li>It is free and open-source;</li>
  <li>It can be run on any modern personal computer with any operation system (Win, Mac, Linux);</li>
  <li>It stores information about patients and theire results;</li>
  <li>It allows for loading custom settings templates;</li>
  <li>It presents results from the test in a readable and intuitve graphic form;</li>
  <li>It enables testing of the patient's visual field for different wavelengths of the electromagnetic wave;</li>
  <li>It enables testing the whole patient's visual field due to the possibility of adjusting the fixation point location;</li>
  <li>It was validated on patients with glaucoma and compared with Medmont M700 perimeter;</li>
</ul>
