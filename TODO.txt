===== Things planned to do in Specvis in future =====
- [!!!] [UTILITY] Add transparency parameter for the stimuli, so it would be possible to perform eg.
blue on yellow visual field examination (similar to the Humphrey Zeiss perimeter possibilities).
- [UTILITY] Add exponential gamma fit for luminance scales creation pipeline.
- [UTILITY] Add reading time reactions.
- [UTILITY] Use different approach for generation of visual field graphical maps than the current one.
- [UTILITY] Add menu bar.
- [UTILITY] Add functionality of printing/saving patient's results in *.pdf.
- [UTILITY] Create procedure for kinetic perimetry.
- [UTILITY] Create procedure for static perimetry, where you will can choose specific area to test.
- [UTILITY] Add possibility to average chosen results of one patient.
- [UTILITY] Add possibility to use unicode symbols in message after fixation loss, such as arrows etc.
- [UTILITY] Add border and transparent background options for message box shown after fixation loss.
- [UTILITY] Add elipsoid indicators of the visual field in the stimuli distribution
preview (10Â° step).

- [NOT YET CONFIRMED] [BUG] When going back to the initial Specvis window, button START is
enabled, but it does not answer to any action.

===== Done for version 1.1.1 =====
- [FIXED] [BUG] When using fixation monitor technique "Blindspot" or "Both", Specvis had displayed
"message after fixation loss" after lack of patient's response to control stimulus shown in the predefined
blind spot location. Now, it displays mentioned message properly, ie. when patient respond to the control
stimulus shown in the predefined blind spot location, which should not be perceived.
- [FIXED] [BUG] When loading settings which use fixation monitor technique "Both", XY positions
of the "message after fixation loss" were placed in the fields corresponding to predefined
blind spot location in the Specvis GUI. Now, settings are loading properly.
- [FIXED] [BUG] When using fixation monitor technique "Both", Specvis did not display information
about its settings in the text area located on the left of the procedure preview window. Now, it
displays it properly.
- [MATERIALS] 6 new predefined settings templates added to the "Settings" folder.
- [MATERIALS] 5 new predefined luminance scales based on relative luminance principles
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_luminance) added to the "screenLuminanceScales.s" file.
All new luminance scales names start with "RELATIVE" prefix. I recommend using this scales, if you
don't have access to the photometer needed for configuration real luminance scales expressed in cd/m2.
